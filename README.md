# JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to our classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, implemented in pure JavaScript! This game offers a simple yet engaging gaming experience, perfect for quick breaks or casual gaming sessions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with either an "O" or "X". The game dynamically updates the grid as each player makes their move.
- **Win Detection:** The game automatically detects and announces a winner based on traditional Tic-Tac-Toe win patterns.
- **Draw Detection:** If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
- **Game Reset:** Players can easily start a new game or reset the current game with dedicated buttons.
- **Responsive UI:** Messages dynamically appear to indicate a win, loss, or draw, enhancing the user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Player Turns:** The game alternates between two players, beginning with Player O. Each click on an empty box places the player's symbol ("O" or "X") in that box.
2. **Win Logic:** The game checks for a winner after every move. A win is detected when a player aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
3. **Draw Condition:** If all boxes are filled without a winning pattern, the game declares a draw.
4. **Reset and New Game:** Players can reset the game at any point using the provided buttons. Resetting the game clears the grid and starts a new game.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply load the `index.html` file in your web browser. Click on any of the grid boxes to make a move. Use the "New Game" button to start over and the "Reset" button to clear the current game state.

Enjoy this classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a modern twist, and may the best player win!
